# A Large Scale Fish Classification Project
 
This Project is included to predict of fish by using deep learning technologies. On the other hand the project is final project of deep learning bootcamp that is organized by Global AI Hub.

The project has pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, keras and tensorflow libraries of python. 

The project is all for training aim.
